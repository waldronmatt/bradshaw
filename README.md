[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/196c079f-cddd-4a20-8c56-7853e9d01e71/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/bradshaw/deploys)

A full stack TypeScript application using OOP and MVC patterns. [Click here to see it live on Netlify](https://bradshaw.netlify.app).

## Purpose

Learn about common architecture patterns and apply them by developing a real-world application.

## Objectives

- Utilize a 3-tier/MVC combination to promote separation of concerns and loose decoupling
  - Model
    - Encompasses the data and business logic tiers of a traditional 3-tier app
    - Includes authentication logic
  - Controller
    - Directly connects business logic to UI logic
  - View
    - Encompasses UI logic, the app styling, and markup generated by JavaScript templates
- Implement architecture patterns using vanilla TypeScript
- Have at least 50% code coverage
- Implement user authentication
- Store and retrieve data using SQL
- Reduce the use of third party libraries for core application logic
- Automate the bundling process and app deployment using Webpack and Netlify
